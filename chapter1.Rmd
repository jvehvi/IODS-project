# Assignment 1

I'm here to learn new skills and improve olds. The course fits perdectly to my needs. I have used R a lot, but havent shared my code outside of our research group, so learning good practises is very welcome.
I did go throw Exercise1 'warm up' pretty fast and everything was pretty familiar. As a note for my self, the syntax and used functions was many way different than what i have used to get same goal. Might be good to start to use less 'intermediate' objects and more 'tidyverse' style. I like to use Atom for writing a script, so it's be nice to try to do things differently.
